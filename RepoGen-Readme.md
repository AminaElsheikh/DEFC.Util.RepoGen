## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
**DEFC.Util.RepoGen** is a .NET CLI tool and NuGet package that helps developers quickly generate repositories and Unit of Work classes that map to SQL Server stored procedures. It is designed to automate repetitive tasks, reduce boilerplate code, and maintain a clean architecture within .NET applications.

This tool empowers development teams to enforce consistent patterns, improve productivity, and accelerate the creation of scalable applications that interact with databases via stored procedures.

### Created by
This tool was created by **Amina El-Sheikh**.

## üéØ Objective
NuGet tool that implements the **repository** and **unit of work** patterns by automating the creation of repositories mapped to database **stored procedures (SPs)**. This enhances developer productivity and helps maintain clean architecture in .NET applications.

## üöÄ Benefits
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Developers don't need to manually create the repository and methods for every stored procedure. The tool can automatically generate them.
- **Enforces Clean Architecture**: The separation of concerns between database operations (in the repository) and business logic (in the service) is maintained.
- **Promotes Maintainability**: When working with stored procedures, the tool keeps the codebase more organized and easier to maintain, as the SP logic is encapsulated in the repository.
- **Speeds Up Development**: Instead of writing repetitive code, developers can focus more on writing business logic by using the generated repositories.
 
## üîå Supported Technologies
The tool is designed to work seamlessly within modern .NET environments using clean architecture principles.

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Providers
- Microsoft SQL Server *(current supported provider)*

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important on Other Databases**
> `DEFC.Util.RepoGen` does **not support PostgreSQL or MySQL** because:
>
> - These databases do not provide the same stored procedure metadata needed for automated mapping.
> - Their procedural SQL dialects differ significantly from T-SQL (used in SQL Server).
> - The tool is tightly coupled to SQL Server‚Äôs stored procedure introspection capabilities.
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** For PostgreSQL or MySQL, consider using EF Core‚Äôs model- or code-first patterns instead.

### ‚öôÔ∏è .NET Versions
- ‚úÖ .NET 6
- ‚úÖ .NET 7
- ‚úÖ .NET 8

> üí° **Important:** The tool is compatible with .NET SDK-based projects and uses `dotnet` CLI commands internally.

### üß± Design Patterns Used
- **Repository Pattern** ‚Äì abstracts data access and encapsulates business logic interactions.
- **Unit of Work** ‚Äì coordinates the writing out of changes and maintains transactional integrity.
- **Command Pattern** (CLI-based) ‚Äì the tool is built around modular command-line operations.
- **Separation of Concerns** ‚Äì enforces clean boundaries between infrastructure and domain logic.

> üí° **Important:** The tool helps teams enforce these patterns consistently across the codebase, especially when working with stored procedures.

### üñ•Ô∏è Recommended Execution Environments
You can run the tool using any of the following:

- **Developer PowerShell for Visual Studio** *(recommended)* ‚Äî provides better visualization and output formatting.
- **.NET CLI** from terminal or command prompt *(recommended)* ‚Äî provides better visualization and output formatting.
- **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio.

> üí° **Important:** For best experience and readability, use **Developer PowerShell** or **.NET CLI**.


## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- Install the following NuGet packages:
  - `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`
  - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
  - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` 

## üì¶ Installation
Install the NuGet Package **DEFC.Util.RepoGen** with version **1.0.0** using the following command:
```bash
dotnet add package DEFC.Util.RepoGen --version 1.0.0
```
## üîß RepoGen.json ‚Äì Tool Configuration

The `RepoGen.json` file is the primary configuration file used by the `DEFC.Util.RepoGen` tool. It allows you to customize key settings that define how the tool interacts with your database and structures the generated code.

### Key Configuration Options:
- **DBContextName**: The base name for your DBContext. The tool will automatically append "DBContext" to it.
- **ConnectionString**: A valid connection string to your database.
- **Namespace**: The application namespace used in the generated code.
- **FoldersStructureModel**: Choose between different folder structure models (e.g., `MODEL_1` for default, `MODEL_2` for layered, `MODEL_3` for hexagonal or `MODEL_CUSTOM` for user-defined model). See: [Folder Structure Models](#-folder-structure-models)
- **LoggerCode**: Controls logger generation for command and batch executions.

> üí° **Important:** The tool automatically appends `DBContext`, `Repository`, and `Service` to the relevant names, so you don‚Äôt need to include those suffixes in your configuration.
```json

//================================================================================
// Notes:
// - The word "DBContext" will be dynamically appended to the DBContextName.
// - The word "Repository" will be dynamically appended to the Repository Name.
// - The word "Service" will be dynamically appended to the Service Name.
//================================================================================

{
  "Config": {
    "DBConfig": {
      "SchemaID": "1", // OPTIONAL: Database schema ID (if applicable)
      "DBContextName": "YOUR_DBCONTEXTNAME_HERE", // REQUIRED: Base name for DbContext (suffix "DBContext" will be added automatically)
       "ConnectionString": "Server=SERVER_NAME;Database=DATABASE_NAME;User Id=USER_NAME;Password=PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=True"
      // REQUIRED: Valid connection string to your database
    },
    "AppConfig": {
      "Namespace": "YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE", // REQUIRED: Base namespace for generated code
      "FoldersStructureModel": "MODEL_1", // REQUIRED: Folder structure
      //   MODEL_1 (Default)
      //   MODEL_2 (Layered)
      //   MODEL_3 (Hexagonal/Ports & Adapters)
      //   - MODEL_CUSTOM (Define your own folder structure to fit your specific project architecture)
      "LoggerCode": "101" // REQUIRED: Logger file generation control
      //   100: No logger
      //   101: Logger for Command & Batch
      //   102: Logger for Command only
      //   103: Logger for Batch only
    }
  }
}
```
### Dynamic Creation of `RepoGen.json`
When you first initialize the tool with the following command:

```bash
dotnet tool run DEFC.Util.RepoGen initial
```
## üìÅ Folder Structure Models

`DEFC.Util.RepoGen` supports multiple folder structure models that enforce clean, maintainable architectures by default.  
You can define your preferred structure via the `FoldersStructureModel` property in your `RepoGen.json` configuration file.

Below are the supported models:

---

### üß± `MODEL_1` ‚Äì Default (Clean Architecture Inspired)

Ideal for small to medium-sized applications that follow the **clean architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns.

‚úÖ **Use When**:
- You want rapid setup, a simple layered structure, and maintainable code organization.
- You're building MVPs, prototypes, or smaller-scale systems where full enterprise layering is unnecessary.

---

### üß± `MODEL_2` ‚Äì Layered Architecture

Follows a classic **layered architecture** with distinct separation between **Presentation**, **Application**, **Domain**, and **Infrastructure**.

‚úÖ **Use When**:
- You're building scalable, enterprise-level applications with well-defined layers.
- Collaboration, modular testing, and separation of domain logic are priorities ‚Äî especially for large teams or multi-service environments.

---

### üß± `MODEL_3` ‚Äì Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

Implements **Hexagonal (a.k.a. Onion) Architecture**, placing business logic at the core and isolating infrastructure via ports and adapters.

‚úÖ **Use When**:
- You need **maximum decoupling** between business logic and external systems (DB, APIs, etc.).
- You're embracing **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, building **microservices**, or prioritizing **testability and modularity**.

---

### üß± `MODEL_CUSTOM` ‚Äì Custom User-Defined Structure

`MODEL_CUSTOM` allows you to define your **own folder structure** to fit your specific project architecture. 
This model is designed for advanced users or teams that already follow a customized layout and want to integrate `RepoGen` seamlessly.

‚úÖ **Use When**:
- You have an existing architecture not covered by the default models.
- You require full control over the names and hierarchy of folders.
- You are integrating RepoGen into a legacy or uniquely structured project.

---

#### üóÇÔ∏è `custom_model.json`

This file defines your custom folder structure. Below is a basic example:

```json
{
  // This file defines the custom project folder structure.
  // You can add nested folders using "Children" arrays.
  // Required folders must exist to satisfy the structure mapping.

  "Structure": [
    { "Name": "DBContext" },     // Folder for database context files
    { "Name": "DTOs" },          // Folder for Data Transfer Objects
    { "Name": "Interfaces" },    // Folder for repository interfaces
    { "Name": "Models" },        // Folder for domain or EF models
    { "Name": "Repositories" },  // Folder for concrete repositories
    { "Name": "Services" },      // Folder for service layer classes
    { "Name": "UnitOfWork" }     // Folder for unit of work implementation

    // Example of a nested structure:
    // {
    //   "Name": "Core",
    //   "Children": [
    //     { "Name": "Repositories" },
    //     { "Name": "Services" }
    //   ]
    // }
  ]
}

```
> üí° **Important:** You can define **nested folders** using the `Children` property to represent complex, hierarchical structures.
#### üóÇÔ∏è `structure_mapper.json`
This file maps required logical components to the folders defined in your structure:
```json
{
  // RequiredMappings define the logical folders your application MUST include.
  // Each key is a required logical role (like 'DTOs'), and the value is the actual folder name in your structure.

  "RequiredMappings": {
    "DbContext": "DBContext",         // This folder represents EF DbContext files
    "DTOs": "DTOs",                   // This folder represents DTOs
    "IRepositories": "Interfaces",    // This folder represents repository interfaces
    "Models": "Models",               // This folder represents models/entities
    "Repositories": "Repositories",   // This folder represents concrete repo implementations
    "Services": "Services",           // This folder represents business/service layer
    "UnitOfWork": "UnitOfWork"        // This folder represents unit of work class
  }
}

```
> üí° **Important:** All required mappings must be defined for the tool to operate correctly.  
#### üõ†Ô∏è Activating MODEL_CUSTOM
To use this model, update your `RepoGen.json` configuration file:
```json
{
  "FoldersStructureModel": "MODEL_CUSTOM"
}

```
Then, apply your custom folder structure by running:
```bash
dotnet tool run DEFC.Util.RepoGen structure set

```
### üõ†Ô∏è Switching Folder Structure

To apply a specific structure, update your `RepoGen.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "FoldersStructureModel": "MODEL_2"
}
```
---

### üß© Choosing a Structure

| Model     | Ideal For                         | Separation Level | Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------------|------------|
| `MODEL_1` | Simple projects, quick start      | Medium           | Low        |
| `MODEL_2` | Enterprise/layered applications   | High             | Medium     |
| `MODEL_3` | Domain-driven, microservices apps | Very High        | High       |
| `MODEL_CUSTOM`| Custom legacy or advanced architectures|	Custom |Variable    |

> üí° **Important:** If you're switching from one structure model to another, manually delete any previously generated folders to avoid conflicts,
 then run the structure setup command again.
```bash
dotnet tool run DEFC.Util.RepoGen structure set
```

## üêû Troubleshooting & Error Handling
This section covers common issues users might encounter while using the tool, along with potential causes and resolutions.
### ‚ùå Error: The option 'XXX' is not valid
**Cause:** This error typically occurs when an invalid option is passed to the CLI tool, or the command is not recognized.
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you are using the Write option.
- Usage: dotnet tool run DEFC.Util.RepoGen help or See [Usage Guide](#-usage-guide) section.
### ‚ùå Error: Invalid command. Please provide valid arguments.
**Cause:** This error typically occurs when an invalid command is passed to the CLI tool, or the command is not recognized.
**Solution:**
- Make sure you are using the Write command.
- Usage: dotnet tool run DEFC.Util.RepoGen help or See [Usage Guide](#-usage-guide) section.

### ‚ùå Error: A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server)
**Cause:**

- This error typically indicates one of the following:
- The SQL Server instance is not running or accessible.
- Incorrect server name or instance name in the connection string.
- The SQL Server instance is not configured to allow remote connections.
- Network issues or firewall restrictions preventing the connection.
**Solution:**

**1- Check SQL Server instance status:**
- Ensure the SQL Server instance is running. You can check the SQL Server instance status through **SQL Server Configuration Manager** or **Services in Windows**.
**2- Verify the connection string:**
- Double-check that the connection string in `RepoGen.json` is correct. Ensure the **server name**, **instance name**, and **authentication credentials** are valid.
**3- Check SQL Server configuration:**
- Ensure the SQL Server instance is configured to allow remote connections.
**4- Check firewall settings:**
- Ensure there are no **firewall** rules blocking SQL Server connections:
**5- Test with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):**
- Try connecting to the database manually using SSMS with the same credentials and connection string.
- If it works in SSMS but not via the tool, there might be issues with how the connection string is configured or passed to the tool.
**6- Check Named Pipes and TCP/IP settings:**
- If the error mentions the **Named Pipes provider**, you may need to configure SQL Server to accept TCP/IP connections instead of Named Pipes:
- Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**, then ensure **TCP/IP** is enabled and configured correctly.
**7- Test network connectivity:**
- Use **ping** or **telnet** to test network connectivity between the application and the SQL Server.

## üîî Important Notes
- **Do not change the folder structure** generated by the tool. It‚Äôs designed to support consistency, clean architecture, and team alignment.
- **Review the auto-generated comments and documentation**, and update them to match your project‚Äôs standards as needed.
- **Avoid modifying or moving generated files manually.** For the tool to work effectively, the file structure must remain intact.
- This tool is built to help your team stay in sync and maintain a **clean**, **maintainable** codebase. Changing the generated structure may cause issues and defeat the purpose of using the tool.
